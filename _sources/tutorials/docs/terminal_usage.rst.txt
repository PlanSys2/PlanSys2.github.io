Overview
========

The terminal is an application that allows the interaction with PlanSys2 to test or monitor its operation. 
It is not essential to use PlanSys2 since your application is expected to manage the plans' knowledge and execution automatically. 
Still, it is useful and convenient to get to know the terminal in these first tutorials.

This tutorial shows how to use the terminal and the main commands and is also a good starting point for working with PlanSys2.

Tutorial Steps
==============

0- Requisites
-------------

Follow the same process as in :ref:`getting_started` for installing PlanSys2. 

We will use a test PDDL domain. If you do not know what PDDL is, it is recommended to take a look at one of these links first:

* `PDDL 2.1 <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.4561.pdf>`_
* `An Introduction to PDDL <http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sheila/2542/w09/A1/introtopddl2.pdf>`_
* `PDDL by Example <http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sheila/384/w11/Assignments/A3/veloso-PDDL_by_Example.pdf>`_

Download a simple PDDL domain for this tutorial. Later, you could reproduce the steps of this tutorial with your own domain:

  .. code-block:: bash

      wget -P /tmp https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IntelligentRoboticsLabs/ros2_planning_system_examples/master/plansys2_simple_example/pddl/simple_example.pddl


1- Launch PlanSys2
------------------

PlanSys2 can be launched with two different launchers that implement two different execution forms: distributed or monolithic. 
In distributed form, each component of PlanSys2 runs in a different process, and to launch it, each component's launchers are called 
in cascade. In monolithic form, all components are released in the same process.

In the first steps with PlanSys2, it is irrelevant how we execute it to choose any of them. Both launchers have a parameter where 
the PDDL domain file to use is specified.


  .. code-block:: bash

      ros2 launch plansys2_bringup plansys2_bringup_launch_distributed.py model_file:=/tmp/simple_example.pddl

If all went well, all components of PlanSys2 will have been launched and awaits requests.

2- Execute PlanSys2 terminal
----------------------------

The PlanSys2 terminal is executed by entering the following command in another terminal:

  .. code-block:: bash

      ros2 run plansys2_terminal plansys2_terminal 

At that moment, an interactive shell will open in which we can enter commands. We can use the up and down arrows to 
navigate between the commands already entered or use ``Ctrl-R`` as in the shell to search for commands. It also has 
autocompletion with the ``Tab`` key. You can quit anytime typing "quit" or pressing ``Ctrl-D``.

It should be noted that the state of the system is at PlanSys2 components, not in the terminal. You can close and 
reopen (or even use several terminals), and the system's state persists. If you want to reset the system, press ``Ctrl-C`` in the terminal
where you launched PlanSys2, and relaunch it.

  .. code-block:: lisp

      ROS2 Planning System console. Type "quit" to finish
      > 

2- Interactive session
----------------------

1. The first thing is to check the domain that is being used. In the PlanSys2 terminal window type:

  .. code-block:: lisp

      get domain

      ( define ( domain simple )
      ( :requirements :strips :adl :typing :durative-actions :fluents )
      ( :types
      	robot - object
      	room - object
      )
      ( :predicates
      	( robot_at ?robot0 - robot ?room1 - room )
      	( connected ?room0 - room ?room1 - room )
      	( battery_full ?robot0 - robot )

        ...

2. To see what types of instances the model contains, type:

  .. code-block:: lisp

      get model types
      Types: 2
	        robot
	        room

3. Use other variations of ``get model`` to get more information of the domain:

  .. code-block:: lisp

      get model actions
      Actions: 0
      	move (durative action)
      	askcharge (durative action)
      	charge (durative action)
      
      get model predicates 
      Predicates: 5
      	robot_at
      	connected
      	battery_full
      	battery_low
      	charging_point_at

4. It is also possible to get the details of a predicate or an action:

  .. code-block:: lisp
      
       get model predicate robot_at
       Parameters: 2
       	robot - ?robot0
       	room - ?room1
       
       get model action move
       Type: durative-action
       Parameters: 3
       	?0 - robot
       	?1 - room
       	?2 - room
       AtStart requirements: (and (connected ?1 ?2)(robot_at ?0 ?1))
       OverAll requirements: (and (battery_full ?0))
       AtEnd requirements: 
       AtStart effect: (and (not (robot_at ?0 ?1)))
       AtEnd effect: (and (robot_at ?0 ?2))

5. So far, we have seen how to inspect the model, which remains unchanged during the 
execution of PlanSys2. We could say that it is the static part of the planning ingredients. 
The other ingredient is the problem, which contains the instances, grounded (not generic as in 
the domain, but already with instances) predicates, and goals. We will check that it is empty for now.

  .. code-block:: lisp

       get problem instances
       Instances: 0
       
       get problem predicates
       Predicates: 0
       
       get problem goal
       Goal: 

6. First, let's add instances. If you analyze the domain, we want a robot to be able to move between rooms. For 
this, the robot must have a battery, and the rooms must be connected. Therefore, we need rooms and a robot:

  .. code-block:: lisp

       set instance leia robot
       set instance entrance room
       set instance kitchen room
       set instance bedroom room
       set instance dinning room
       set instance bathroom room
       set instance chargingroom room

If no errros, these instances can be checked by typing:

  .. code-block:: lisp

       get problem instances
       Instances: 7
       	leia	robot
       	entrance	room
       	kitchen	room
       	bedroom	room
       	dinning	room
       	bathroom	room
       	chargingroom	room

7. To add predicates, we type:

  .. code-block:: lisp

       set predicate (connected entrance dinning)
       set predicate (connected dinning entrance)
       
       set predicate (connected dinning kitchen)
       set predicate (connected kitchen dinning)
       
       set predicate (connected dinning bedroom)
       set predicate (connected bedroom dinning)
       
       set predicate (connected bathroom bedroom)
       set predicate (connected bedroom bathroom)
       
       set predicate (connected chargingroom kitchen)
       set predicate (connected kitchen chargingroom)
       
       set predicate (charging_point_at chargingroom)
       set predicate (battery_low leia)
       set predicate (robot_at leia entrance)

Let's check it:

  .. code-block:: lisp

       get problem predicates
       Predicates: 13
       (connected entrance dinning)
       (connected dinning entrance)
       (connected dinning kitchen)
       (connected kitchen dinning)
       (connected dinning bedroom)
       (connected bedroom dinning)
       (connected bathroom bedroom)
       (connected bedroom bathroom)
       (connected chargingroom kitchen)
       (connected kitchen chargingroom)
       (charging_point_at chargingroom)
       (battery_low leia)
       (robot_at leia entrance)

8. The predicates and instances previously added to the problem are the knowledge used to 
generate the plan. Also, we need to have an objective of our planning, which is a logic expression 
to end up being true. It is usually a predicate that we want to add to the knowledge:

  .. code-block:: lisp

       set goal (and(robot_at leia bathroom))

9. At this time we can ask that the plan be calculated to obtain this goal:

  .. code-block:: lisp

       get plan
       plan: 
       0	(askcharge leia entrance chargingroom)	5
       0.001	(charge leia chargingroom)	5
       5.002	(move leia chargingroom kitchen)	5
       10.003	(move leia kitchen dinning)	5
       15.004	(move leia dinning bedroom)	5
       20.005	(move leia bedroom bathroom)	5

To create the plan, the first thing to do is generate two files: ```/tmp/domain.pddl``` and ```/tmp/problem.pddl```. 
You can check that they are there from the last planning. In fact, we can run the planner directly by typing in a shell in another terminal:

  .. code-block:: bash
       
       ros2 run popf popf /tmp/domain.pddl /tmp/problem.pddl

10. We can also delete instances, predicates or the goal:

  .. code-block:: lisp

       remove instance leia
       remove predicate (connected entrance dinning)
       remove goal 

11. What we will not be able to do is execute the plan (we would do it with the ``run`` command) because there is no node 
running right now that implements the domain actions. We will see that in the next tutorial.
